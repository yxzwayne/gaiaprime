hetzner for server monitoring

u can literally selfhost *almost* everything u need as lightweight as possible u wanted 
- project management? plane dot so 
- u wanted documentation? docusaurus 
- wanted backup that isnt just scp? borg + hetzner box 
- wanted version control? gitea 
- wanted collab chat? firechat or mattermost 
- wanted to lock all of this behind vpn? wireguard 

i could go on but all of this and monitoring, logging etc u can do on a super small server that will run u this amount per month this isn't to shit on subscription services, serverless or whatever the fuck, but more to show people who don't know that you can have *almost* everything you need under ur own control

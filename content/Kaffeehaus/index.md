A curated collection of articles and links I find enjoyable and insightful to read. 

Kaffeehaus was the name of Viennese coffee houses in the late 1800s, where people gathered to exchange ideas and engage in lively debates. In that spirit, I wanted to put together a digital "Kaffeehaus" to explore challenging but interesting contents and perspectives.

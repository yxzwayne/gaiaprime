LDA is a probabilistic topic modeling technique that helps discover latent topics in a collection of documents. 

# Intuitions of LDA
Bayesian Intuition:
- Documents are mixtures of topics
- Each topic is a probability distribution over words
- LDA assumes a generative process for creating documents

Process:
1. Choose the number of topics K
2. For each topic k=1...K, draw a word distribution φ_k ~ Dirichlet(β)
3. For each document d:
   - Draw a topic distribution θ_d ~ Dirichlet(α)
   - For each word w in document d:
     - Draw a topic z ~ Multinomial(θ_d)
     - Draw a word w ~ Multinomial(φ_z)

Model:
- Input: 
  - A corpus of D documents
  - Hyperparameters α and β
- Algorithm:
  - Inference: 
    - Variational Inference: Approximate posterior distribution of latent variables (topic assignments and distributions) using simpler distributions and optimize to minimize KL divergence
    - Gibbs Sampling: Sample latent variables iteratively from their conditional distributions given the current state of other variables
  - Parameter Estimation:
    - Estimate φ and θ from the inferred latent variables
- Output:
  - K topics, each represented by a word distribution φ_k
  - Topic assignments z for each word in each document
  - Topic proportions θ_d for each document

The key idea is that LDA assumes documents are generated from a mixture of topics, and each topic has a characteristic distribution over words. The inference task is to reverse this process - given the observed documents, infer the latent topic structure that likely generated them.

# Steps I should follow

Step 1: Preprocessing
- Tokenize the documents into words.
- Remove stop words and perform any necessary text cleaning (e.g., lowercasing, removing punctuation).
- Create a vocabulary of unique words from the document collection.

Step 2: Document Representation
- Represent each document as a bag-of-words, i.e., a vector of word counts.
- Create a document-term matrix where each row represents a document, and each column represents a word from the vocabulary.

Step 3: Initialize LDA Parameters
- Choose the number of topics (K) you want to discover.
- Initialize the document-topic distribution (theta) for each document as a uniform distribution over K topics.
- Initialize the topic-word distribution (phi) for each topic as a uniform distribution over the vocabulary.

Step 4: Gibbs Sampling
- Randomly assign each word in each document to one of the K topics.
- For each word in each document:
  - Remove the current word from its assigned topic.
  - Calculate the probability of assigning the word to each topic using the following formula:
    P(topic t | document d, word w) ∝ (n_dt + α) * (n_tw + β) / (n_t + βV)
    where n_dt is the number of words in document d assigned to topic t, n_tw is the number of times word w is assigned to topic t across all documents, n_t is the total number of words assigned to topic t, V is the vocabulary size, α and β are hyperparameters for smoothing.
  - Sample a new topic for the word based on the calculated probabilities.
  - Update the counts n_dt, n_tw, and n_t based on the new topic assignment.
- Repeat the above steps for a specified number of iterations or until convergence.

Step 5: Estimate LDA Parameters
- Estimate the document-topic distribution (theta) for each document:
  theta_dt = (n_dt + α) / (n_d + Kα), where n_d is the total number of words in document d.
- Estimate the topic-word distribution (phi) for each topic:
  phi_tw = (n_tw + β) / (n_t + Vβ).

Step 6: Interpret and Evaluate Results
- For each topic, sort the words by their probability in the topic-word distribution (phi) to get the most representative words for each topic.
- Evaluate the quality of the discovered topics using metrics such as perplexity or coherence.

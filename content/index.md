This is Wayne's Gaia Prime – a place of searching, learning, and optimism in face of adversity. 

Build the Adjutant, Build Ayre, Build Apollo. This is my Terminus.

### Why Gaia Prime?

The name is from the world of [Horizon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horizon_Zero_Dawn) and is symbolic of my personal journey. In the game, "Gaia Prime" is the central hub of Gaia, the AI system designed to restore life to post-apocalyptic Earth. It represents hope, resilience, renewal, and optimism in the face of adversity.

Similarly, my path in science and tech has been one of rediscovery and reinvention. Having a late start in programming and a circuitous route through PoliSci, I only found my true passion in AI research through machine translation in late 2022 (for good and bad, the breakthrough happened). I didn't know 

Like the human in Horizon, I had to catch up on skills and knowledge while carving out my own unique path. So, I adore "Gaia Prime" as my commitment to making a meaningful impact in the field of AI. It serves as a reminder that, despite the gaps from the brilliant minds I look up to, I am capable of becoming a builder and doer, and jointly shape the future with other technologists.

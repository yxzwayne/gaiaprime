Thoughts from [Jason Wei's tweet](https://twitter.com/_jasonwei/status/1693688114626052410).

He says character is an entirely different direction. Working on Luxun is one such attempt. However, I will need to answer, what are the existing product scenes for characters? How do they do the character distinction? Through fine-tuning or something?

I argue that if we try to acquire a generalist reward model that can act as an understanding and intent-discovery model, that finds the core values and centric ideas of a person, then that can be used to retrieve intents and individual consciousness to a certain extent.

One direction of completing this model is to look into... (thoughts interrupted)

I know this is being approached and dealt with nicely with delphi (or something), i just think it would be nice to be able to do that on my laptop.

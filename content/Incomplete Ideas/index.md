title: Incomplete Ideas
---
Recording my rough and somewhat denoised ideas in projects and research. Hopefully you know what inspired the title of this page.

I also curate ideas I see from others that I think are relevant in my direction. When I do so, I tend to attribute the original poster by adding their name and contact on top and write some short notes on the relevance.

Feel free to grab and go if you see something interesting, or [reach out](mailto:yxzwayne@gmail.com) and see if we can hack together!

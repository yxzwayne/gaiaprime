Develop a system to automate the process of taking notes during lectures, leveraging LLMs (large language models) to intelligently summarize and organize the content. The system should be able to generate concise, comprehensive notes without requiring manual input or formatting work from the student.

Key considerations:
- Ensure the system can accurately transcribe spoken lectures and extract the most salient points.
	- Sometimes the transcription is provided by some sort of automated but noisy process (hallucination of highly technical and niche terms)
- Summarize or not? Ideally, we should preserve the originality of documents, since backlinks should be created on the basis of true note contents. 
- Need to think about hierarchical mining.

This is important because each of us that has the self-respect of keeping a personal knowledge base will benefit from this kind of automation (or intelligence, if we actually crack it). In fact, I think it's entirely possible that the actual technique that works is going to be something designed to tackle an entirely different problem.

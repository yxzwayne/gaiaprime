The paper discusses the challenges faced in real-world learning tasks when dealing with complex or hard-to-specify objectives. Using simpler proxies for these objectives can lead to poor performance or misaligned behavior. The authors propose an alternative training strategy called Iterated Amplification, which progressively builds up a training signal for difficult problems by combining solutions to easier subproblems. 
- This method is closely related to [[Expert Iteration]] but does not rely on an external reward function.

# Components

- ML Agent $X$, autoregressive model trained to predict $	ext{Amplify}^{H}(X)$’s output
- Human $H$;
- $	ext{Amplify}^{H}(X)$: the composite of human $H$ and a many $X$ working together (?????)

# Algorithm

1.  Define a base model: Start with a base model or "weak expert," which is a neural network (or any other learning algorithm) that can perform the task to some extent but is not yet optimal.
    
2.  Decompose the task: Break down the main task into a series of smaller, more manageable subproblems. This can be done using task-specific heuristics, domain knowledge, or other methods.
    
3.  Solve subproblems: Train the base model to solve these subproblems, generating a dataset of input-output pairs for each subproblem. This can be done using supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or other learning approaches.
    
4.  Amplify the model: Combine the solutions to the subproblems to create an "amplified" version of the base model. This amplified model should be better at solving the overall task than the original base model. The amplification process can involve various techniques, such as distillation or fine-tuning, to transfer knowledge from the solutions to the subproblems to the main model.
    
5.  Iterate: Repeat steps 2-4 with the amplified model, further decomposing the task and solving subproblems. Each iteration should result in a progressively better model, capable of handling increasingly complex tasks.
    
6.  Terminate: Continue iterating until the model reaches a satisfactory performance level or a predefined stopping criterion is met.


# Arguments

```
As long as it is possible for multiple agents to collaboratively solve problems more effectively than a single agent (perhaps using human expertise to coordinate their efforts), 

-> then AmplifyH(X) can outperform X and hence provide a useful training signal
```

So, are we humans complex enough so we can be our own reward function?

```
All of the copies of X are trained exclusively to solve the problem they are given. We don’t need to manage incentives, politics, or conflicting preferences, which are common difficulties in human organizations.
```

lol nice

# Summary

Complex objectives problem: Traditional approaches to learning suffer when faced with complex objectives that are hard to specify. The paper introduces Iterated Amplification as an alternative strategy to address this issue by breaking down the task into simpler subproblems.
- So, uses dynamic programming to effectively dissect problems;

Human limitations: The authors acknowledge that relying on humans for demonstrating or judging performance can be ineffective when dealing with highly complicated tasks. Iterated Amplification overcomes this limitation by developing a training signal that is not dependent on direct human evaluation.

Comparison with Expert Iteration: Iterated Amplification shares similarities with Expert Iteration, an existing training approach. However, a key difference lies in the absence of an external reward function in Iterated Amplification, which makes it more suitable for tasks with complex or hard-to-specify objectives.

Scalability: The paper presents results from algorithmic environments that demonstrate the scalability of Iterated Amplification. This approach can learn complex behaviors efficiently, making it suitable for a wide range of applications.

Recursive structure: One interesting aspect of Iterated Amplification is its recursive structure, which allows it to iteratively improve the training signal by decomposing tasks into simpler subproblems and combining their solutions.

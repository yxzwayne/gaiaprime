# Motivation

Current model evaluation metrics leave unclear whether GPSMs faithfully reproduce the complex multi-residue mutational patterns observed in natural sequences due to [[Epistasis]].

# Contribution

- Develop a set of sequence statistics to assess the “generative capacity”
	- r20 score
- Potts model’s generative capacity is largest.
	- Why? The higher-order mutational statistics generated by the model agree with those observed for natural sequences.
- VAE comes second to Potts.

## What are existing metrics?

# Presumptions of this paper

- The fact that Potts maximum entropy models are limited to pairwise epistatic interaction terms and have a simple functional form for _p_(_S_) raises the possibility that their functional form is not flexible enough to describe the data
	- Are they tho? Checking this [paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5869684/)
	- "they capture higher order correlations induced by mutations evolving under constraints and help quantify the connections between protein sequence, structure, and function maintained through evolution"
		- wat mean?

# Backgrounds

"genotype" and "phenotype":
1. **Genotype**: This refers to the genetic makeup of an organism. The genotype is the set of genes in DNA. In the context of mutations, the genotype would include the specific genetic variants or alterations in the DNA sequence. In machine learning terms, you can think of the genotype as the underlying dataset or the input features that determine the outcome.
2. **Phenotype**: The phenotype is the observable characteristics or traits of an organism. This includes physical appearance, biochemical properties, physiological traits, and behavior. The phenotype results from the interaction of the genotype with the environment. In the context of machine learning, the phenotype is analogous to the output or the results that come from processing the input features (genotype) through a series of functions or algorithms.

In the paper's context, epistasis refers to the interaction between different genes (genotypic interactions) and how these interactions can affect the observable traits (phenotypic outcomes). The research on deep mutagenesis is likely exploring how various genetic mutations, both individually and in combination, can influence the resulting characteristics of proteins and RNAs, which are crucial for understanding biological processes and structures.

The VAE can potentially gives insight into the topology of protein sequence space through examination of the “latent” (hidden) parameters of the model, which have been suggested to be related to protein sequence phylogenetic relationships

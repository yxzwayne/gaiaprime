title: Containerization Notes

I need to containerize my VAE training program so I can deploy them on run.ai. The last time I have done this was 4 years ago and I have not touched docker ever since, so I document the process for reference.

First, I will need to create a docker container. I know what they are. I think I just need to actually configure one.
- I need a dockerfile.

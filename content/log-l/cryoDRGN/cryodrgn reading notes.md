# Reconstructing continuous distributions of 3d protein structure from cryo-em images (2020)
- Cryo-EM is used to determine protein structures at near-atomic resolution.
- Central problem in using cryoEM is to reconstruct 3D structures from thousands to millions of noisy 2D images.
- Structural variability in proteins complicates this reconstruction.
- Traditional discrete clustering methods don't fully capture protein dynamics.
- A new method models continuous variability in protein structures.
- It uses coordinate-based deep neural networks in Fourier space.
- The method trains on unlabeled 2D images, inferring orientation and structural heterogeneity.
- It combines exact and variational inference techniques.


Question:
1. How was reconstruction being handled before?
2.

# Data 1
`/log-l/netapp/data6/abiswas/cryoDRGN/J139/tutorial/J277-02_vae1024_d96-2/analyze.49/`
- The working directory is `..`
- Saved PC1-filtered two bins to `/data2/log-l/wazhang/cryoDRGN_help/output/`
- Divided the latent space into 10 slices based on descending order of Principal Component 2 values, saved to `/data2/log-l/wazhang/cryoDRGN_help/output/pc2_bin6_out_of_10/`
- Saved the cumulative the top 5, top 6, and top 7 datapoints at: `/data2/log-l/wazhang/cryoDRGN_help/output/cum_top_indices_J277-02_vae1024_d96-2/`
# Data 2 - May be used in paper
`/log-l/netapp/data6/abiswas/cryoDRGN/J139/tutorial/00_vae96/analyze.49`
- The working directory is also `..`
- Drew **10** slices based on Principal Component 2 in descending order as above. And then saved the cumulative the top 5, top 6, and top 7 datapoints separately as top5.pkl, top6.pkl and top7.pkl
	- Saved at `/data2/log-l/wazhang/cryoDRGN_help/output/00_vae96_anal_49/`

# Current task:
For `00_vae96`:
- [x] Make a figure showing the top 5, 6, and 7 selected sequences for PC2. 
- [x] Make similar slices on PC1 and save the top 5, 6 and 7 cumulatives.
- [x] Make figure for PC1 selection.

For `J277-02_vae1024_d96-2` data:
- [x] Make a figure showing the top 5, 6, and 7 selected sequences for PC2.
- [x] Make similar slices on PC1 and save the top 5, 6 and 7 cumulatives.
- [x] Make figure for PC1 selection

# Background
1. HIV rapidly mutates and acquires drug resistance mutations (DRMs) under selective pressure from antiretroviral therapy (ART), leading to complex mutation patterns and potential treatment failure.
2. The impact of a mutation on protein stability and fitness depends on the entire genetic background due to epistasis, and the accumulation of associated mutations can lead to the entrenchment of primary resistance mutations.
3. Modeling epistasis is crucial for identifying drug and immune pressure-mediated mutational combinations that give rise to drug-resistant, stable viruses, and co-evolutionary information from multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) has been used to build models for protein structure and fitness, including Potts statistical models.
4. Recent studies using Potts models have inferred epistatic interactions involved in the evolution of drug resistance in HIV-1 protease, and this paper confirms these predictions, showing how such models capture epistatic interactions leading to drug resistance in HIV protease, reverse transcriptase, and integrase.
5. Potts models are maximum-entropy models that capture pairwise mutational correlations caused by epistasis, and the statistical energy of a sequence is interpreted to be proportional to fitness, with the effect of a mutation being background-dependent.

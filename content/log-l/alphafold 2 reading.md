Abstract: 

Previously discovered protein structures only cover a little in the billions of possible proteins.
Problem:
- predicting 3D protein structures based solely on amino acid sequences.
- existing methods didn't do atomic accuracy well, especially when no homologous structure is available.
Method:
- neural network incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure,
- add multi-sequence alignments into the design of the deep learning algorithm.

# questions from first pass:
- what is the physical and biological knowledge about the protein structure encoded here?
